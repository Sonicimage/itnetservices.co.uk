                       Hi, my name is Lucia. My interest from the very start evolved around music which I focused on studying for many years. When I moved to London in 2006, I wanted to pursue career in a Music industry. Eventually, I soon
                       realised I wasn't qualified enough due to lack of credentials that this country was looking for to get full time employment. In addition to music, my passion also lied in technology, which is why I decided to combine the two. I went on to study Music Technology at university, where I learned about music production.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       From there onwards, after I graduated, I knew the route I wanted to take. I enrolled on a course in IT, for which I sat exams to obtain MCSA. Our tutors themselves were studying for CCNP, and they gave us further opportunities to build on networking skills. As time went by, I became highly motivated to continue in networking. I took this chance to educate myself more in this area. Such determination helped me to gain CCNA and then CCNP qualifications. Along with that I also obtained MCSE.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                       Throughout my whole study period I was employed by different  companies on fixed term contracts most of the time. However, I came to realisation that switching to a contracting/freelancing would be more suitable for me. The benefits from that I found appealing, as this offers flexibility, can help to improve my discipline, and the idea of working from home was second to none.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                       Ever since I started learning about web design and      development, as well as studied graphic design, color theory, and typography. I decided to focus on HTML and CSS, which in spite of their challenges has been phenomenal to work with. When I was able to create my first website, I was proud of how far I have come already, and I will continue on this path of growing my skillset. Please do contact me with any comments, suggestions, or questions you may have regarding the website and services.
